# Root Craft

Root Craft is a web app that allows front-end developers to generate custom `:root` variables for their projects. With Root Craft, you can easily create a color palette and export it as a CSS file or a JavaScript object to use in your project.

## Getting Started

To get started with Root Craft, clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```js
git clone https://github.com/filipeprado90/rootcraft.git
```

Then, run the development server:

npm run dev
```

This will start the app at http://localhost:3000.

# Features

Some of the key features of Root Craft include:

- Pre-defined color palettes, such as Material Design and Bootstrap, to help speed up the design process.

- Customizable options for naming conventions, variable prefixes, and other settings to match the user's project requirements.

- Exporting options to allow users to save their generated :root variables in different formats, such as a CSS file or a JavaScript object.
